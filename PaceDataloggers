WIRE SETUP
Anemometer
Wire the WSD-100 Cable to the XR5 as follows: 
	Black 	X 	Wind speed contact closure
	Green 	1 	Wind direction potentiometer
	Yellow	D 	2.5v Potentiometer supply voltage
	Red 	C 	Ground
				
Solar radiation
SRS-100 with 2 ft cable:
	Green 	Channel 2 Output signal: 1.67 mV per W/m2
	Red 	C 	Ground
	Black 	C 	Ground
	Yellow 	E 	Power: +5V DC, 1 mA

Temperature
PT9xx sensors:
	Connect one lead of the temperature probe to the Channel #. 
	Connect the other lead to a ‘C’ terminal. Leads are not polarity sensitive.

Check that the sensors are working properly by selecting Real Time>Graph and looking at the readings.
