To program or monitor the incubators, type the IP address for the incubator of interest into the address line of an internet browser (either Internet Explorer or Google Chrome) using the laboratory computer.  The incubator must first be switched-on to access the controls.  If need be, it is possible to access the chambers’ controls from any computer hard-connected to the lab’s network.  The software is pretty straightforward.  However, detailed directions are available in the instruction manuals for the chambers which are in the laboratory.  The basic software can run a constant setting, simple diurnal setting, or more complicated programs that can be entered step-by-step.  The chambers can also be programmed via their attached controls.  This is somewhat more difficult, but directions are also included in the manual

The username and password for accessing the chambers are:

Username: ADMIN
Password: PSIADMIN

Using additional software (WeatherEze), the chambers can also be set to recreate actual conditions at weather stations of modelled conditions anywhere on the planet.  The software is installed on the laboratory computer.  Again it is pretty straightforward, and detailed instructions are available in the manual






Additional Huey Chambers

These are older Percival chambers (chamber #5 and #6).  They cannot be controlled remotely.  Two temperatures can be set (day and night) and are on a timer and the lights are on a timer.  The controls are all analogue.  For the timers, “on” is when the pins are pulled out and “off” is when the pins are pushed in.
